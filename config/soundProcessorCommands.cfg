-- sound processing definitions for audio postprocessing
--
-- This configuration file contains a list of sound definitions.  Each
-- sound definition is a string of sox commands.  Additionally the
-- string may contain "tee" pseudo-commands that defines split points
-- where a temporary file is generated when debugging.  This may be
-- helpful for listening to intermediate states of audio processing.
--
-- A sound definition consists of the sound name and the sox command
-- string (without sox command and file names).  This is a strict
-- sequential processing, there is no splitting outside of the sox
-- mechanisms.
--
-- As always in configuration files one may use auxiliary variable to
-- keep common string data.

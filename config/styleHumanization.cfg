-- style humanization strategies for MidiTransformer script;
--
-- The strategy describes how how the timing and the velocity may be
-- changed depending on the position of a note within a measure.
--
-- The velocity factor is a factor that is applied to the existing
-- velocity and then the slack is the possible variation. E.g. a
-- velocity factor of 0.8 with a slack of 10 means that the original
-- velocity is reduced by 20% and then a random offset in the interval
-- [-10, 10] is applied.  The random distribution is quadratic around the
-- center.
--
-- The timing is a variation as a factor of thirtysecond beats.
-- E.g. a value of 0.25 means that the timing may be off by at most a
-- 128th before or after the beat (25% of a thirtysecond note).  When
-- the percentage has an "A" prefix (for "ahead"), the offset is always
-- negative, for a "B" prefix (for "behind") it is always positive.
--
-- Additionally there is a global setting for instrument dependent
-- scaling factor on the velocity and timing variation.  A drum is
-- very tight and has a factor of 1.0 each which means that the
-- calculated variation is taken directly; a bass is slightly more
-- loose and has a factor of 1.1 for velocity and 1.05 for timing
-- which means that the calculated variations are scaled accordingly.
